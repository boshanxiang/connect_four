# Connect Four App

## Overview

I created a simple game of Connect 4.

The game is playable between two players upon arrival to the site. Play input is made by clicking on the relevant column to which a player desires to add a token.

The game is adjustable at the bottom--players can decide to make the game board surface an arbitrary number of columns and rows, with an arbitrary number of tokens to be connected for a win.

The game allows players to play multiple games. When a player wins a single game, their overall win record tally increases. Tie games do not increase any player's score.
